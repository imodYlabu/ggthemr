However, this book is not cheap. It costs $80 to buy from the official publisher's website[^1^]. If you want to save some money and get access to this valuable resource for free, you may be wondering how to download Applied Drilling Engineering SPE PDF for free. Well, there are some ways to do that, but you need to be careful and ethical. Here are some tips and precautions to follow:
  
- Check if your library or institution has a subscription to OnePetro, the online library of technical literature for the oil and gas exploration and production industry. OnePetro has a digital version of Applied Drilling Engineering SPE PDF that you can access online or download for offline reading[^1^]. You may need to log in with your library or institution credentials to access OnePetro.
- Search for other online sources that offer Applied Drilling Engineering SPE PDF for free download. However, be wary of websites that may contain malware, viruses, or illegal content. Do not download anything from untrusted or suspicious sources. Also, respect the intellectual property rights of the authors and publishers. Do not share or distribute the PDF without their permission.
- Consider buying a used or second-hand copy of Applied Drilling Engineering SPE from online marketplaces or bookstores. You may find a cheaper price than buying a new one from the publisher. However, make sure that the book is in good condition and has no missing or damaged pages.

Applied Drilling Engineering SPE PDF is a great book for anyone who wants to learn more about drilling engineering. It is a valuable reference for students, researchers, engineers, and professionals in the oil and gas industry. However, it is not easy to find a free download of this book online. You need to be careful and ethical when looking for one. Alternatively, you can buy a copy from the publisher or a used one from other sources.
  
## What is Applied Drilling Engineering SPE?
  
Applied Drilling Engineering SPE is a book that covers the fundamental principles and current practices of drilling engineering. It is part of the SPE textbook series, which is a collection of books that provide authoritative and comprehensive information on various aspects of petroleum engineering. The book was first published in 1986 and has been widely used by students, researchers, engineers, and professionals in the oil and gas industry.
  
The book is divided into eight chapters, each focusing on a different topic related to drilling engineering. The chapters are as follows:

1. Rotary Drilling Process: This chapter introduces the basic concepts and components of rotary drilling, such as the drill string, drill bit, drilling rig, power system, hoisting system, circulating system, and well control system. It also discusses the factors that affect the rate of penetration, such as bit type, weight on bit, rotary speed, mud properties, formation characteristics, and hydraulics.
2. Drilling Fluids: This chapter explains the functions and properties of drilling fluids, such as transporting cuttings, cooling and lubricating the bit and drill string, maintaining wellbore stability, preventing fluid loss and formation damage, and controlling formation pressure. It also describes the types and compositions of drilling fluids, such as water-based muds, oil-based muds, synthetic-based muds, and air or gas drilling.
3. Cements: This chapter describes the purpose and process of cementing operations, such as isolating zones, supporting casing strings, protecting casing from corrosion and erosion, and sealing off lost circulation zones. It also discusses the properties and types of cements, such as compressive strength, thickening time, fluid loss control, rheology, density, and additives.
4. Drilling Hydraulics: This chapter analyzes the flow behavior and pressure distribution of drilling fluids in the drill string and annulus. It also covers the design and optimization of drilling hydraulics, such as nozzle selection, bit hydraulic horsepower, jet impact force, equivalent circulating density, pressure losses, surge and swab pressures, and mud pumps.
5. Rotary Drilling Bits: This chapter reviews the types and characteristics of rotary drilling bits, such as roller cone bits, fixed cutter bits (PDC or diamond), hybrid bits (roller cone/PDC), core bits (conventional or wireline), and reaming bits. It also covers the selection and evaluation of drilling bits based on factors such as formation hardness,
bit wear rate (dull grade), bit performance (ROP vs WOB), bit life (cost per foot), bit hydraulics (nozzle size and placement), bit design (tooth shape and profile), bit breakage (causes and prevention), and bit run records.
6. Formation Pore Pressure and Fracture Resistance: This chapter explains the concepts and methods of estimating formation pore pressure and fracture resistance. It also discusses the causes and effects of abnormal pressures (overpressure or underpressure) on drilling operations. It also covers the techniques and tools for detecting abnormal pressures (such as kick indicators) and preventing wellbore instability (such as mud weight control).
7. Casing Design: This chapter covers the objectives and procedures of casing design. It also discusses the factors that affect casing strength and integrity (such as axial load,
internal pressure,
external pressure,
bending stress,
buckling,
collapse,
burst,
tension,
and corrosion). It also covers the types
and specifications of casing materials (such as steel grades,
connections,
and coatings). It also covers the methods
and criteria for selecting casing sizes
and setting depths.
8. Directional Drilling
and Deviation Control: This chapter covers
the reasons
and methods for drilling directional wells
(such as horizontal wells,
multilateral wells,
extended reach wells,
and sidetracks). It also discusses
the tools
and techniques for measuring
and controlling wellbore trajectory
(such as survey instruments,
steering tools,
deflection tools,
and software). It also covers
the planning
and analysis of directional drilling operations
(such as well path design,
dogleg severity,
torque
and drag,
hole cleaning,
cementing,
and completion).

The book also includes two appendices that provide additional information on non-Newtonian fluids in a rotational viscometer and slot flow approximations for annular flow for non-Newtonian fluids.
